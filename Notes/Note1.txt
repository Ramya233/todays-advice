API 

 You want to be able to talk to the servers, of open weather to get information
 but you don't know how their database works etc.

 so open weather has an API through which they can interact with their database. 
 There are these services you can access, via their API

 You are doing a get request via the api to get the data in response on 
 your website.

 Post request is used to send over the data to the mailchip servers.
 In response you will get a status code of 200 if successful and 404 for error.

You can imagine an API doc like a menu, specifying, what you want? 
And you can make the request using http.
Mybe you need to make a post req, or a get req.

  follow a particular set of rules.

  1) The first rule is that you use an HTTP Protocol to interact with the API.









When you look at the doc for an API, it almost looks like a menu.
