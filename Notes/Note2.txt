Till now we have built a front-end and back-end for our websites.
We make a get request for our servers to open a new webpage, 
In response the server will respond with some data.

The above if you see carefully, is like hitting up some private API.

What we are interested in is talking to someone eles's server.
But this time it's done via a public API.


Structuring API Request
Formatting API Request 
1)EndPoints - BaseURL/EndPoint (eg:https://www.baseurl.com/home)
eg : /random , /filter are some endpoints in the boredapi 

2)Path Parameters - endpoints are going to be fixed, while path-parameters can change.
It is basically variable, it can be id/user name/etc.
Path parameters can be viewed as for identifing resources.
eg: You want to always display a specific resources with a key=80980 or id=77656
for this you can use the path parameters
eg:https://bored-api.appbrewery.com/activity/5914292

3)Query Parameters - baseurl/endpoints?query=value (eg:name=kappa)
You can also have multiple query Parameters. - (baseurl/endpoints?query=value&query=value)
