What is JSON ?
JavaScript Object Notation - Because the data looks like javascript objects

But there is a little difference between JSON and javascript object

JSON formate is like : 

coord": {
        "lon": 72.8479,
        "lat": 19.0144
    },

JavaScript is like :

var world ={
    water : "blue",
    land : "brown",
    countries : 195
}

You can use jsonviewer.stack.hu.

The resaon we use JSON is because it is human readable, also can be shrinked in size.
We can colapse the javascript object into a string in the JSON format and once we receive that JSON string, we can 
build it back into the original javascript object.

JSON is not the only format - that we can use to receive data from an apis, we can also use xml, html.
JSON is the most favourable as it easy to turn into javascript format.


While sending data on the internet you would want to it to be in the json format
You would need to perform serialization.
const jsonData = JSON.stringify(data); (data=js object);
converts all js objects to string.

Now when you want the data again in the js object format.
We use  const data = JSON.parse(jsonData);
data.name etc, to access anything in the jsobject
